# SENT (J2716) HLA

This is the high-level analyzer to use in conjunction with the Dataspeed SENT low-level analyzer.

This HLA is able to decode both fast and slow-channel frames, and interpret fast-channel sensor information as
actual units, assuming the SENT slow-channel describes the required sensor properties.
