# SENT (SAE J2716) Analyzer for Saleae USB logic analyzer

To build on Windows, open the visual studio project in the Visual Studio folder, and build. The Visual Studio solution has configurations for 32 bit and 64 bit builds. You will likely need to switch the configuration to 64 bit and build that in order to get the analyzer to load in the Windows software.

To build on Linux or OSX, run the build_analyzer.py script. The compiled libraries can be found in the newly created debug and release folders.
